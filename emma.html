    <h1>Emma my coolest (and only) cat</h1>
    <h3>Let me tell you the story about how we met Emma</h1>
    <p>I have had the coolest cat I've ever had (technically my first cat) well over a decade, and the story of how we met (my wife Amber was with me) is kinda cute. We walked up to the first room and in the middle of a room stuffed full of cats is a small kitten huddled into a ball looking for a way out. She was the only one to lock eyes with us since the rest seemed unaware or uncaring about the outside world. Once she knew she had our attention she tried to convey her desire to leave with every fiber of her being Amber lemented about how cute it was that it was looking into her eyes, almost looking into her soul. I made a joke about it but regretted it once she locked eyes with me. I felt like she was talking to me, and I was the a-hole being like, come on we just got here. So we looked around at the rest of the cats and we had gone through the whole area when we came back to her. All the rest of the cats were in their own world none were paying any mind at all so Amber relented and we asked to visit with her for a moment.</p> 
    <p>We spent time with her in the visiting area where we saw that she had just recently been spayed the day before. Once she felt comfortable she immediately cuddled into my lap to warm her shaved belly. My wife chose the name Emma for her emerald eyes. On the way home we passed a preschool with a sign Welcome Emma, as my future mother-in-law was complaining about the name so my wife used that as the perfect serendipitous reason to reaffirm the name Emma. After a day or two we realized she was super sick, she had a flu, worms, and fleas. She was easily the sickest cat I had ever seen sneezing more snot than most people get with an awful cold and getting snot everywhere when she would shake her head, but within a few days her health completely turned around. Now she is a proud kitty and while she may be afraid of our children and any small creatures (especially cats), she is happy cuddle buddy whenever the kiddos are away and is one of the happiest kitties I have ever met.</p>
